# Quality Assurance Engineer Challenge

## Problem Description:
Test a RESTful API for a patient management system. The codebase can be found at this [GitHub repository](URL).

## Requirements:
1. Clone the repository and set up the application.
2. Write test cases to cover the following scenarios:
    - Adding a new patient (valid and invalid data)
    - Retrieving patient details by ID (existing and non-existing ID)
    - Updating patient details (valid and invalid data)
    - Deleting a patient (existing and non-existing ID)
    - Listing all patients
3. Implement mocking capabilities to simulate external dependencies and services.
4. Generate test data to validate different scenarios.

## Tools:
- Use a testing framework like Postman, JUnit, or any other preferred tool to write the tests.
- Use a mocking framework like Mockito for Java to mock external dependencies.
- Use a library like Faker to generate test data.
- Automate the tests using a continuous integration tool like Jenkins.

## Bonus Points:
- Implement performance tests to check the API's response time.
- Provide a report of the test results, including any bugs or issues found.

## Submission:
- Provide a link to the GitHub repository with the test cases.
- Include instructions on how to run the tests and view the report.
